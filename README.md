# ToDo-Using-DI
Hey there! This is a project born out of my journey to learn Jetpack Compose and dependency injection on Android. Apart from Jetpack compose and DI, I wanted to refine the knowledge of MVVM, Room Database and Kotlin Coroutines in the process.

## About the App

This ToDo app can be used to keep track of your tasks. I designed it with Jetpack Compose, a modern Android UI toolkit, to make the user interface.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks:** Easily manage your tasks with simple and intuitive actions.

- **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark modes based on your preference or the time of day.
  
- **Filter Tasks** Filter tasks on the basis of their priorities.

- **Search Tasks** Search through the tasks by simply typing a matching character.
## Tech Stack

I've leveraged some cool technologies to make this app come to life:

- **Jetpack Compose:** For a declarative and modern UI.
  - [Jetpack Compose Documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Used DI to keep my codebase clean and modular.
  - [Dagger Hilt Documentation](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)

- **Room Database:** For saving tasks in local DB.
  - [Room Persistence Library Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)

- **Kotlin Coroutines:** To perform CRUD operations asynchronously.
  - [Kotlin Coroutines Documentation](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)

- **MVVM Architecture:** For separation of concerns.
